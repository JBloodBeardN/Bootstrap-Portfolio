# Bootstrap-Portfolio

https://jbloodbeardn.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/index.html

this was a project for homework in ut flex full stack program

This uses bootstrap grids and components to put together a rough portfolio. Round 2 will be updating the actual content when I have more worthwhile work toward the end of the project.
